meta_globals.py in src:
Added "GLMM: Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_MERIC_NAMES
Added "GLMM" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_ONE_ARM_METRICS
So user can choose "GLMM" when starting a new project. It does not seem to break the system, but it does not do anything 
either.
