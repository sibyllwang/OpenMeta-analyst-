meta_globals.py in src:

added "GLMM: Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_MERIC_NAMES
added "GLMM" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_ONE_ARM_METRICS
so user can choose "GLMM" when starting a new project. It does not seem to break the system, but it does not do anything either
