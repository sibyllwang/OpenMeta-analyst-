meta_globals.py in src:
Added "GLMM: Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_MERIC_NAMES
Added "GLMM" in ##binary metrics - BINARY_ONE_ARM_METRICS
So user can choose "GLMM" when starting a new project. It does not seem to break the system, 
but it does not do anything either.
Updated: Although now I think about it, GLMM should not be added to "metrics", but "analysis method" when 
creating forrest plot.
Changes deleted in meta_globals.py

BINARY_ONE_ARM_METRICS is called in meta_py_r.py and main_wizard.py

binary_methods.r in src/R/openmetar/R
Defines different methods but I want to know where these methods are called in the UI.
